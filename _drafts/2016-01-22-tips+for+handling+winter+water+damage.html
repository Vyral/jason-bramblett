The Triad area experienced some water damage this winter. Maybe you experienced a flooded basement or crawlspace, overflowing gutters, or a similar issue. likewise, we've had a ton of rain here this season. What can you do to repair and prevent water damage?<br /><br />First,<b>&nbsp;determine where the water is coming from. </b>It might be as simple as having overflowing gutters. Gutters can dump a lot of water into crawlspaces or basements.<br /><br />Also,&nbsp;<b>ensure your downspouts push water away from your home. </b>New build guidelines require that downspouts take water ten feet away from your property. Many downspouts just dump water right at the edge of your foundation.<br /><br />Finally, check your flowerbeds. They might have settled and allowed water to flow directly into your home. <b>Flowerbeds should slope away from the foundation.&nbsp;</b><br /><br />Most of these are simple observations you can make yourself. However, if you need to hire a professional, contact us! We can put you in touch with several great contractors to help you with your water issues.
