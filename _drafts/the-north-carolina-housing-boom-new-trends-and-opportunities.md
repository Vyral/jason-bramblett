Throughout the last few weeks, the market has truly been ramping up, and there has been a tremendous number of people taking action. Countless people have decided to move to North Carolina from out of state, and our communities are seeing the impact. Now that we have passed the pandemic, many people are deciding to buy second homes and other things they wouldn’t have done before. With all of this going on, I am here to clear the air and keep you informed on a few important things.&nbsp;

First, know that **inventory is still tight, so home values are still strong.** However, if you’ve been frustrated trying to buy during the last few years, know that there are some great homes on the market. Things aren’t quite as competitive either, which will give you more opportunities.&nbsp;

To find success, you need to know where listings are, because not all of them are on the internet. Many people are ready to sell, they just need to find the right home to buy. Therefore, there are a lot of opportunities there. People just don't want to move twice if they don’t have to, which is very understandable, as moving is never fun. It’s crazy how much stuff we accumulate!&nbsp;

Still, know that we have a large database of people who are ready, they just need the right house, which means their home will soon be available and isn’t online. Therefore, **you need to work with a real estate professional who will work hard to help you find listings.** Things aren’t going to just happen for you without work. You need to find someone who will put in the time and effort to help you find your dream home.&nbsp;

There may be more opportunities out there than you think. Therefore, if you want help buying or selling a home, know that I’m here to help. You can call or email me anytime and I would be happy to assist you.
