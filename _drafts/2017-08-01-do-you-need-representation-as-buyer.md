It’s very important to have representation as a buyer. Here are a few reasons why.

Do you need an agent representing you when buying a new home?

In our opinion, it’s very important to have representation as a buyer. When you visit a model home or a sales office, the person there isn’t working for you. They are working for the builder and have their best interests in mind. It behooves you to have someone acting in your best interest as well. They are a second set of eyes on the paperwork and on all of the details in the contract. **There are certain fees and non-refundable deposits that they are aware of.** You might miss those if you’re doing things on your own.

As someone who has been in real estate for a long time, I know the process of how to walk you through new construction from start to finish. I know the things to look for and can put leverage on the builder if things start to run behind. A huge benefit of hiring a buyer’s agent is their ability to juggle things around so that you have a smooth closing. **They can also help be an advocate for other resources you may need such as an attorney, a home inspector, or a mortgage lender.**

Having agent representation during the new construction process is essential, whether you’re building your first home or your 12th. The extra professional looking out for your best interests is always a welcome addition.

If you have any questions about hiring a buyer’s agent or anything else relating to the buying process, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to help you out.
