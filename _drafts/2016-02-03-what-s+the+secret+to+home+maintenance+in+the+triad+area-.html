<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Home maintenance is one of those things we're often asked about. Since most people have limited time and money, it's hard to pick and choose which projects to take on.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Our advice? <b>Do the things you feel comfortable with. </b>It is advisable, in the spring and the fall, to have your heating and cooling systems serviced. There are a lot of things that can be checked out from a preventative standpoint to maybe push off some these big-ticket items should something break. The biggest thing you can do is keep the system clean and change the filters as recommended by the manufacturer.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>You should also pay close attention to your appliances. </b>Make sure you're following the manufacturers specs on them. Most specs are easily found online nowadays.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>The water heater is another item you have to keep an eye on. </b>Most have 10-12 year lifespan, but if you're getting discoloration or sediment in your water heater, you may want to have a plumber come out and look at it professionally. We don't recommend that anyone mess with a water heater on their own, as it can be dangerous.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>If you need a quality contractor or vendor of any kind, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. </b>We've been working in the area for years and have met many of the most trustworthy professionals in every industry.
