The<b> Kyros House is a house for terminally ill children. </b>It gives chemo treatments to kids from families who would be living in the streets without the help. The home was started over 20 years ago by a family in Guatemala and was designed to help five or six people at a time, but <b>there are typically more than 20 individuals living there at any given time.&nbsp;</b><br /><br />Over the years, it has experienced some setbacks in terms of maintenance. <b>We're reaching out to you to ask for help building a new facility for these kids.</b> We plan to buy some land within walking distance of the hospital and build a new structure. There are a few different ways you can help:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Join a team to help build the new facility: </b>We'll be leading teams to go down to Guatemala to build the structure. If you would like more details about the cost and time requirements, feel free to email us or give us a call.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Sponsor the day with a $2,000 donation: </b>If you are a small business owner, we've come up with a sponsorship program you can donate to. For $2,000, you'll send us your merchandise, and everyone working on the project will wear your logo and colors for a day. We'll be shooting video, taking photos, gathering testimonials, and anything else we can do to help promote your business in your home town. We'll do this by creating a fantastic video for you to put all over your social media and send to local news outlets.&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nVHuOs_6rOM/VI8UhE_o4PI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/IX4Y4Kv70Ts/s1600/12.2-Charity.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nVHuOs_6rOM/VI8UhE_o4PI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/IX4Y4Kv70Ts/s1600/12.2-Charity.jpg" height="200" width="200" /></a><b>Our goal is to reach $2.5 million,</b> and we think we can get a couple hundred thousand by the end of the year to really get things moving. Everything will be funneled through a 501(c)3 called Carolina's Promise. They already have a board in place to oversee the funds and ensure accountability for the funds that are raised.<br /><br />Again, shoot us an email or give us a call for some of the specifics. We would love for you to help us really make a difference in the live of children!
