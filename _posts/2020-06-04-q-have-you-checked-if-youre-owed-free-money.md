While doing some title work recently for a client, I came across the fact that they were owed some money that was sitting in the unclaimed property website. **There is quite an extensive list of people who are owed money, and you might be one of them.** How does free money sound?

[Here’s a link](https://www.nccash.com/claiming-your-unclaimed-property) to the North Carolina unclaimed property resource. Just click on your county and look for your name. **If it’s there, you may be getting some money back.**
