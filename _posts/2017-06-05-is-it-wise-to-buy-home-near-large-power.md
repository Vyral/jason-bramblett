Homes located near large power lines can present a great opportunity if they have the right price and you’re buying one for the right reasons.

Should you buy a home near power lines and will that ever harm your family?

As to whether it’s safe or not, I’ll let you determine that for yourself. In my 19 years in real estate, I've found that homes located near large power lines present an added risk to the buyer, and sellers tend to struggle selling them in our market. These properties have one of the highest foreclosure rates.

However, **they can also be a good investment opportunity as rentals.** I’ve seen some of them be discounted by as much as 30% to 40%, and these homes were located in great neighborhoods as well. As far as renters are concerned, they know that they’ll only be there a short time, and the quality of the home is typically fantastic.

The prospect of buying one for your family is a decision you’ll have to make, but I’ve seen phenomenal opportunities to buy discounted real estate in neighborhoods near large power lines. There is only a small percentage of people who won’t buy a home near a large power line, just like there is only a small percentage of people who won’t buy a home near a pond, a busy street, or a corner lot.

**Would I shy away from one of these homes? Not for the right price and the right reasons to buy.**

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to helping you.
