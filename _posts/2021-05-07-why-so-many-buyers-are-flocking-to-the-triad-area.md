<center><em>Out-of-state buyers are pouring into our market, and here’s why.</em></center>
&nbsp;


In a recent interview, I was asked about where people are moving to in the United States, where they’re coming from, and why.

Funnily enough, migration patterns are so specific right now that it seems like someone drew a bullseye on a map. North Carolina is seeing a huge influx of buyers from California, Colorado, D.C., North Dakota, Virginia, Florida, Texas, and the list goes on and on. And these are just from conversations I’ve had this week.&nbsp;

**There are a variety of reasons why people are moving here.** Some newcomers have become permanent work-from-home employees, so they’re now free to live wherever they please. It allows people who’ve always wanted to retire in North Carolina to move here, work for a few more years, and have a headstart on their retirement moving goals. Other people are already at retirement age and have chosen to come here to enjoy their golden years. We’re also seeing a lot of job relocations.

Some people are coming down from up north to escape the busy city life. They say that the things they used to enjoy have disappeared, and things may not get back to normal for a while. It’s also very expensive. On the flip side, even though home values have gone up in the Triad, we’re still one of the most affordable places to live. We also have a great quality of life, fantastic schools, and tons of family-friendly attractions.

Many people moving here are bringing a lot of equity with them, as they’re relocating from much more expensive areas. They’re able to put more down on their purchases and secure bigger, better homes for themselves. Additionally, many of these folks are high earners, and they could potentially help stimulate our local economy.

**However, we need more homes to help host this influx of ready and willing buyers.** If you’ve been thinking about selling, now’s the perfect time to hop into the market. I’d be happy to help you figure out what your home’s worth and what you should do to ensure you get top dollar from these eager homebuyers. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
