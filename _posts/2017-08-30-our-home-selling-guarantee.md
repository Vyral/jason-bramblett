At Jason Bramblett Real Estate, we have only one goal: to get your home sold.

At Jason Bramblett Real Estate, we have only one goal: to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.

There’s a big difference between getting a listing and selling your home. Most real estate agents work with both buyers and sellers. We believe this creates a conflict of interest for you, the seller. **This means that even if a buyer doesn’t buy your home, the agent could still sell them any home on the market and make commission off that sale.**

Our listing agents at Jason Bramblett Real Estate are not allowed to work with buyers—as a result, they can devote 100% of their time to getting your home sold. If we don’t sell, we don’t get paid.

With our Coming Soon marketing program, **we change your position from reactive to proactive,** getting you the most money for your home. We’ll make sure to root out all the deal-killing snags that may come up and offer third-party services to you at a hugely discounted price.

Don’t believe us? See what Barbara Corcoran has to say in the video above.

To learn more about our marketing strategy or talk to an agent about selling your home, give us a call. We look forward to working with you!
