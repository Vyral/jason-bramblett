Today we’re going to talk a little about our VIP list, how it works, and how it can help you as a homebuyer.&nbsp;

It’s a very simple process. First, head over to&nbsp;[jasonbramblettrealestate.com](https://www.jasonbramblett.com/), put in your information, and start looking at homes. All you need to do is **notify us****&nbsp;that you’re interested in the VIP property list when filling out your info**, and our team will reach out.&nbsp;

Next, we’ll set up a strategy session for you to get the exact details of what you’re looking for in your next home. Then we’ll connect you with a mortgage partner to get you 100% approved. This goes past the traditional pre-qualification, and you'll be ready to look for a home once you’ve completed the process. If you’re paying cash, we’ll just skip that step and get a proof-of-funds letter instead.

**At this point, you’re purchase-ready as a homebuyer.** We’ll start sending you properties that match your goals, your price range, and needs. The homeowners on our list want to sell but don’t necessarily want to deal with all the chaos going on in the real estate world by listing on the open market.

If you find a home you like, we’ll set up a private home tour with the homeowner. You won’t have to be lining up out the door or fight your way in. With so few homes on the market right now, showings often get fully booked on the first day.&nbsp;

This doesn’t happen with our VIP buyer list. These homeowners want to sell, and they’re willing to sell for the right price. We’re just bringing buyers and sellers together for a better overall experience on both sides of the transaction.

If you have any questions about our VIP list, buying a home, or anything else related to real estate, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon
