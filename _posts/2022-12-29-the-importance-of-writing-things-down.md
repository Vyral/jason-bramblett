Are you ready for 2023? There is a lot to be excited about, and I know I get excited when I look at the incoming group of Realtors. I have been attending real estate schools in our area, and **it has been very encouraging to see all the promising new talent.** If you are interested in joining my team or learning more about our culture and values, visit my website by clicking [here](https://jbreteam.com/).&nbsp;

As we head into the new year, many people will make resolutions and goals about what they want to accomplish. However, this is easier said than done. How can we improve the likelihood of truly sticking to our goals? To help with this, I have two tips: **write things down and keep all those notes in one place.&nbsp;**

Life gets busy, and it is too easy to forget things, so it’s important to write things down. You can use pen and paper, your phone, a software program, or whatever you prefer. Then, make sure it’s all in the same folder or location so those notes don’t get lost.&nbsp;

If you ever need my help, know that I am just a call or email away. I look forward to hearing from you\!
