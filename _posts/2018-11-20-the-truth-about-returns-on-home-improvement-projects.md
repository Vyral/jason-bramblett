When it comes time to make home improvements, **many people hope (and expect) to make $2 for every $1 they spend. Unfortunately, this is not a very realistic goal.**

When homeowners put money into their property, they rarely get back 100% of their investment—let alone double it. Even kitchen upgrades, which bring some of the highest returns, only tend to earn homeowners 87% of their original investment.

**Earning money through real estate isn’t generally achieved by making improvements—it’s achieved by buying property at the right price for its value.** For example, if you purchase a home that’s only five years old and renovate its kitchen, you would be very unlikely to see any sort of return. If you purchased a 30-year-old home with a kitchen that had never been upgraded, though, remodeling could be a fruitful endeavor.

Usually, homeowners will earn the highest return when they improve upon home features that haven’t been upgraded in a number of generations.
