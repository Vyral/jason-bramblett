Will home prices fall off a cliff? Should homebuyers wait out this market and see what happens? No. If I’ve learned one thing in my career, it’s that waiting is the most expensive thing to do in real estate. When buyers tell me they want to wait and see, I hear that they are scared, which is totally fine, but you can’t let fear control you.

**There’s no way to know whether waiting will pay off or not.** No one knows what’s going to happen in real estate. If you knew that the market would double in the past 33 months, you would’ve bought every home you could. Not even the billionaires and the smartest people on the planet could predict what was coming, so why do you think you have the crystal ball?

That’s why I think this thought comes from fear. You’re scared, and you’re punting the ball down the road, but that's fine. **It’s okay to be scared, but admit it, and we can discuss the numbers.** Real estate professionals are here to help give you clarity, get you unstuck, and do the math with you.

There are lots of tremendous reasons to own a home. Regardless of the interest rate, people still find value in owning a home. The real question is: Will you sit on the sidelines and pay 100% interest while you rent, or will you move forward and buy a home?
