We frequently receive questions about whether one should buy an existing home or a new construction house. Which is better? There is no “right” answer to this question. However, **there are pros and cons to consider for both.&nbsp;**

When looking at a new construction home, you should think about how many decisions you’ll have to make. A blank slate isn’t for everyone. You’ll have to make anywhere between 4,000 and 5,000 decisions within this process. Paint colors, cabinets, fixtures, lighting, trim, shingle color—all kinds of selections need to be made. Some of these decisions will be extremely difficult for some people. If this seems overwhelming, building your own home may not be for you.&nbsp;

Building a home is also going to cost you considerably more than buying an existing home. Additionally, building a home takes time, so if you need to be in a home quickly, this isn’t the right option for you.

On the other hand, there could be some issues in existing homes that aren’t apparent right away. **Not all homeowners maintain their homes properly** or in the way that you would. However, many professionals can help, including home inspectors, electricians, plumbers, HVAC contractors, and so on. These professionals can check out any home to ensure everything is working properly. Also, buying an existing home means you may not get exactly what you want, so you might have to upgrade or redesign things to your taste.&nbsp;

The decision of whether to build a home or buy one simply comes down to peace of mind. Consider what works best for your lifestyle.
