*Many would never consider buying a home sight unseen. Today I’m discussing why it’s less risky than you think. *

Today we’re discussing how to buy a home sight unseen but diminish your risk. Take for example the process of buying a car; you do your research online, watch videos, learn statistics, then go to the dealer for a test drive. Besides the feel of the car, what did you learn from the test drive? Most people have no mechanical knowledge, so they don’t know if the car is running great or not. This same principle applies to buying a house.
