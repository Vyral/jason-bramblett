It feels like we went through a few years of astronomically low mortgage interest rates. So far this year, they’ve come back up multiple times. We’re seeing rates in the 6% range and higher these days, so money is going to be a little more expensive for homebuyers going forward.&nbsp;

1:42 — The question that potential buyers need to focus on now

2:48 — Why I hope rates don’t come back down

3:42 — How this interest rate jump will actually help first-time homebuyers

5:40 — Why it still makes the most sense to buy even with higher rates&nbsp;

7:15 — Final thoughts

If you're planning to buy a home, don't get too caught up over news about rising interest rates. You missed the boat on the low rates we had at the beginning of the year, but you still have a great opportunity to secure a home and build equity. Buying remains a much better option than continuing to rent.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about rates, how to get qualified, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
