<center><em>Today I’m answering a question about the merits of a fenced-in yard.</em></center>

&nbsp;

This week’s question comes from Susan and Bill. Here’s what they had to say: “Mr. Bramblett, we have a fenced-in backyard, but our fence is in need of replacement. My husband thinks we should just remove it and not replace it, but we’re in a family neighborhood and I think a new fence would add value to the house. Is it worth the investment to replace the fence for between $6,000 and $8,000?”

**My simple answer is yes.** A fenced yard is actually one of the top five things buyers are looking for in a home today. It’s near the top of the list for most of them. Given the price you’re being quoted, I believe it would add a ton of value to the home. You might not see a 100% return on your investment, but you will get a large portion of your money back.

**One additional factor that could play into your decision is the road traffic near the home.** If you’re on a busier street or road, the more desirable that fence will become to buyers.&nbsp;

I’ve found that in a lot of family-friendly neighborhoods, you do see more fences. **If you don’t have one and your competition does, that puts you at an automatic disadvantage.** However, no fence is better than a fence that’s falling down or falling apart.

It’s an ongoing benefit to your home for having it fenced in. If you spend $8,000 in a new fence, you should see at least half of that come back into your pocket if not more. If it’s nicer than your neighbors’ fences, you may even see a greater return.

If you have any other real estate-related questions from me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
