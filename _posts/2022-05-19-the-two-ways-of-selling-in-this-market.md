Selling a home these days is crazy. Most real estate agents are being lumped together as idiots; people will say that it’s so easy to sell a house that anyone can do it. That is simply not the case. This market is like nothing you’ve ever seen, so you had better hire someone who has the processes and systems to see you through it. I want to dive into how this market works and talk about the two ways you can sell your home in it.
