With Hurricane Florence approaching land, I wanted to extend a quick message of caution to everyone in the Triad area. Homeowners in our area should take a moment to assess any potential hazards on their property before the storm arrives. Make sure to close any open windows, secure or store any loose items around the exterior of your home, and take a moment to check in with your neighbors in case they need any assistance in preparing for the storm. Finally, don’t hesitate to reach out to our team if there’s anything we can do to help. Be safe out there. To see our full message, watch this short video.
