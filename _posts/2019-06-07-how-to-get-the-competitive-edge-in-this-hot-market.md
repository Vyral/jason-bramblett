Multiple-offer situations are rampant in our market, meaning that buyers should expect competition when they bid on a home they love. With all the competing homebuyers out there, what can you do to get the edge in this hot market? Here’s a suggestion for you: Give the seller time to move out.&nbsp;

In your offer, consider allowing the owner to stay in the home for seven to 10 days after closing so they have time to move to their new home. **This could give you a huge amount of leverage.** Think about it: People will pay for convenience to move out of their home when they choose to and may choose an offer that allows them to do that, even if your offer is monetarily lower than another’s.
