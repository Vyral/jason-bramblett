As we head toward colder weather, it is crucial to ensure your home is prepared. Have you thought about that yet? If not, now is the time. A lot of damage isn’t discovered until the spring, so it’s important to get ahead of those damages. To help you get ready for the winter, I have created a list of four things you should think about:&nbsp;

1. **Clean out your gutters.** If you own a rental property, don’t rely on your tenants to do this. I like to say gutters are the number one nemesis of homeowners, as they can cause many issues, so get them cleared out.&nbsp;
2. **&nbsp;Hire someone to check your roof.** The key here is to hire someone with insurance, otherwise you’re responsible if they get hurt on your property.&nbsp;
3. **&nbsp;Inspect the vents.** If you have a crawl space, ensure the ground level is below the vents.&nbsp;
4. **Look at the downspouts.** Ensure they’re connected to the extension pipes. This is a problem that I see often, and it’s the number one cause of basement leaks that I have seen in our area.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It’s one thing to deal with problems and mess when the weather is nice, but it’s another thing when it’s 14 degrees outside. Therefore, take preventative action today. If you have any questions about this, call or email me anytime, I’d love to help you.
