In March of this year, people will be flying to the Triad from all over the country to gather for the real estate event of the year where they can network with some big thinkers and learn how to take their real estate businesses to the next level. Attendees will learn how to create their value propositions, how to distinguish themselves from other agents in their marketplaces, and how to be compensated like professionals. If you’re a local real estate agent, **I highly recommend that you attend on March 19 from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.**

The event is all about how to make a “Disney-like” experience for our clients. When you deliver above and beyond whatever their expectations were, it creates a kind of euphoria, like when you first go to Disneyland. That’s how you amass raving fans and gain customers for life. Last year, we had a 41% referral rate from our past clients—the industry average is only 16%—because we deliver service that exceeds expectations.

This is going to be an action-packed, interactive, and educational experience where we dive into deep learning and thinking. It won’t be one of those superficial seminars where they only discuss surface-level topics. No, we plan to dig into the hard questions to help you nail your presentation and blow the doors off of 2022.

It’s a great opportunity to invest in yourself. **If you’re interested in attending, visit**[**www.RealEstateSpeedSchool.com**](http://www.realestatespeedschool.com) **and click “Register.”** Don’t hesitate to reach out to us with any questions you have in the meantime. And remember: We’ll either see you *at* the top, or we’ll see *from* the top.
