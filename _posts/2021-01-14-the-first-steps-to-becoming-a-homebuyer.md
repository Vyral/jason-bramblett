<center><em>Here&rsquo;s the right way to get started buying a home in today&rsquo;s market.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Today I’m talking to all the future homebuyers out there. It can be a barrel of fish hooks out there when it comes to buying a home, and many mistakes can be made. We want to ensure you have minimal mistakes by providing you with our detailed home-buying plan.

**The first thing our plan does is ensures that you won’t have to fly by the seat of your pants.** If you haven’t sold a home in 10 years or more, processes have changed, but we can help guide you through all of those changes. Having a plan helps remove a lot of that stress.

**The most expensive part of the home-buying process is the mortgage.** Most people don’t factor that in and only look at the home’s price, but the cost of a mortgage is a necessary part of the equation for 90% of homebuyers. We educate our buyers about this step and make sure they know exactly what they’re getting into. Although the money seems free, it’s not. The interest rate and fees all go into a loan's cost.&nbsp;

The best way to put yourself in a position to win is to work with an agent who has good relationships with local lenders. There is a lot to figure out here. When you have all the information, you can have the confidence to make a good decision. If you don’t have all the information, you’re setting yourself up for failure.&nbsp;

If you’re not prepared and your dream home comes on the market, you’re likely too far behind to win it. **There are certain steps you need to take before actually looking at a home so you’re ready to buy in a competitive market like this. We can help you with those, too.**

As we go through each step of the process, you’ll gain more knowledge, giving you more peace of mind. By getting this information early on in the process, a lot of our buyers end up making smarter decisions than a buyer who didn’t have that prior knowledge.

If you have any questions for me about buying a home or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
