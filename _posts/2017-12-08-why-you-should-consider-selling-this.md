One question that we get asked frequently during this time of year is, “Should we sell in the winter?” This year, the answer is yes. Absolutely. This is a golden year for you to get top dollar for your home.

{% include pullquote.html %}

Inventory levels across the country are down and there are hundreds of buyers on our site looking for homes just like yours. Some are getting frustrated and deciding to build new homes because they can't find anything. **There are a ton of people relocating to the area right now who are looking for properties as well.** The situation is like this across the Triad.

Buyers are serious right now and are searching with a mission. If you or someone you know has been entertaining the idea of selling a home, get in touch with us. **We’d be happy to help you take advantage of this seller’s market.**

In the meantime, we hope you had a great Thanksgiving and have an even better Christmas. Happy holidays!
