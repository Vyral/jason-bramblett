This time of year, we get hundreds of calls from people who want to make a change. It’s a perfect time for reflections, and that gets many people thinking about upsizing or downsizing their homes. Over the past year, we’ve heard a lot from people who are looking to move but can’t find any replacement homes they like that are for sale.

If you’re in this position, good news\! By hiring us as your real estate professionals, we can help you overcome your real estate barriers. We can do this because **we know where to look to find homes that aren’t yet on the market.&nbsp;**

We have people in our databases who aren’t ready to put their homes on the market, but they say if we can find someone who is looking for a home like theirs, they may consider selling. Many people want to sell their homes privately because they simply don’t want the inconvenience of listing them on the open market, and others are still in the process of considering whether to sell their homes at all.

In fact, some of the best opportunities that we create for our clients aren’t found online. By networking and forming connections with all types of people, and by having these types of conversations hundreds of times each month, our number of off-market sellers increases.

If you’re having trouble finding a home to buy and it’s preventing you from selling your current home, or if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email. We’d love to discuss your options and see if we can’t find a property you love despite our low-inventory market.
