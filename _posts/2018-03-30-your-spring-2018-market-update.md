It’s officially spring, so **what can we expect from the spring real estate market?**

<div class="post-cta">
Selling your Triad area home? <a href="http://guaranteesaleinfo.com/" target="_blank">Get a free home analysis report</a><br>
Buying a Triad area home? <a href="http://www.findhomesingreensboro.com/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>
</div>

It’s exciting to see that prices are actually increasing and that homes are starting to appreciate in the marketplace, which we haven't seen in 10 years, at least.

Nationally, **inventory is very low,** and it’s likely we’ll run out. How do we overcome that?

{% include pullquote.html %}

As buyers reach out to us about certain areas, cities, and neighborhoods, **we’ll reach out to homeowners to introduce them to buyers.** If they’re a good fit, maybe you’ll consider selling your home. It’s a great time to take advantage of low inventory if you’re a homeowner who is mobile.

If you’d like to upsize or downsize your housing situation or just look at the value of your home in the Triad area, feel free to reach out to us.
