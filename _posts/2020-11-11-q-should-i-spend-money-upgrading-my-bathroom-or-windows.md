<center><em>Are new windows or a new bathroom more valuable in your home?</em></center>
&nbsp;

This week’s question is another great one: Jennifer wants to know, “Is remodeling the bathroom a better investment than replacing the windows in my house?”
My advice is based on my decades of experience in this business: Windows are usually the better investment.&nbsp;

For starters, they’ll help with the energy efficiency in the home. They’ll also greatly reduce traffic and other outdoor noise. Utility costs will go down with new windows because they make your home more energy efficient. **From a resale standpoint, windows are the way to go.**

Additionally, most windows carry a transferable warranty, which can be a great sales incentive for future buyers. Windows are going to outlast pretty much any bathroom remodel you can do. If you aren’t planning on selling for another decade or so, a bathroom remodel now won’t help you when the time comes to list. New windows very well could.&nbsp;

**However, if you’re simply looking for more enjoyment now while you’re living in the home, the bathroom may be the smarter choice.** If your windows aren’t bothering you now, it might not make as much sense for you to replace them until you are ready to sell.&nbsp;

Each situation is unique, of course. If you have any specific questions about your home and the things you can do to increase its value, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
