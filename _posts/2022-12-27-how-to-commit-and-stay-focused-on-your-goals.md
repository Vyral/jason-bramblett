Over the years, one thing that I’ve noticed among our team members is that when they’ve set a goal and they’re committed to it, they get it done no matter what. The “how”—whether it’s money, people, or resources that they need to reach their goal—usually follows once they’ve decided to commit. Today I want to explore this topic and talk more about the power of setting goals.
