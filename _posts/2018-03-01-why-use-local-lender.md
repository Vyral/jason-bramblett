One of the things I get questioned about a lot is mortgage lending. Many people tell me, “I used this bank last time I refinanced my house and that went pretty good so I think I’ll use them again.” However, be careful. **These large lenders offer what may appear to be a discount, but they make it up in additional junk fees.**

Here’s what we are finding. People are being enticed by working with these big online lenders, but these lenders aren’t giving the right information, funds, or materials in order to close on time. With our local lenders, we see the opposite. **When you work with a local lender, you are much more likely to close on time.**

We recently had a person who thought they had everything taken care of with their online lender, but the loan didn’t close when it was supposed to. They are now going to have to stay in a hotel all weekend with their moving truck because we couldn’t get the loan closed.

**If moving in on a specific day is important, don't risk it by saving $4 a month on your payment.** Working with a local lender makes a huge, huge difference. We have two great local lenders we'd be happy to connect you with.

If you have any other questions or need anything else, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
