2022 is going to be my year of giving back. I want to take everything I’ve learned over the last 24 years and help educate others. I see so many newer agents with lofty goals of success, but they lack the planning to reach those goals or the knowledge of what goals aren’t realistic. I’ll be holding an event in the Triad on February 17 from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.
