I hope everybody had a phenomenal year in 2017. I hope you achieved your goals and are ready to make some new ones.

Selling your Triad area home? <a href="http://guaranteesaleinfo.com/" target="_blank">Get a free home analysis report</a><br>
Buying a Triad area home? <a href="http://www.findhomesingreensboro.com/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>
</div>

**We saw more home appreciation in the Triad Area in 2017 than we had in the previous 10 years!** I think that trend is going to continue right along in 2018. This is going to be the best year to sell your home in the last decade from what I can tell.

If you didn’t get your home sold this year, give us a call and we will make sure that it does. We were able to serve over 580 families in 2017 and we hope to serve another 1,000 in 2018. **We’d love to add you and your family to our list of fantastic clients.**

If you have any questions for us about real estate or there is anything that you need help with, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
