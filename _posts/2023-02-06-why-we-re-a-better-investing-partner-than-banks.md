Should you partner with us or a bank? We’re a little biased, but we think we’re the right choice in most circumstances, and here’s why.&nbsp;

Take for example a real estate investment trust. Banks pull people's money together–it could be a hundred thousand investors. They put their money in a pot and buy stuff. That’s not what we do at all. We would never dilute your investment by combining it with other funds.&nbsp;

In the mortgage world, when you’re the primary investor, it’s called having the first position. That just means if something goes really, really bad, you get paid first, just like your bank. This is important because **when banks foreclose, they're going to get their money first.** The IRS will get their money, then the bank, and then the first position holder.&nbsp;

To put things simply, banks have their best interests at heart, not yours. When you invest with us, our goal is to make sure you get your money’s worth; **we won’t bail on you if things go south.** If you have any questions about this or another topic, please call or email me. I am always willing to help!
