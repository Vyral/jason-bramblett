Clickbait alarmists spout all kinds of nonsense, but the truth is that home values are holding up in our area. What's in store for this spring? That’s what I want to dive into today.

Heading into a spring market, we normally see a little rise in home values. However, there were a few years that we did not: 2009 and 2010. That's when we were still trying to figure out who was getting blamed for the mortgage and appraisal fraud crisis.

**I'm very optimistic about this spring.** There just isn't much Wall Street manipulation in this real estate market. I think we're just still operating on good old-fashioned supply and demand economics. We still only have 1.2 months of supply, which is very low. However, when supply was down to just 13 days last year, 45 days sounds pretty exciting. Demand is also increasing every day—our web traffic is the highest it's ever been in January. So many people are relocating here from other states.

If you want to hear more information about our local market, or if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
