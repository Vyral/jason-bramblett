What do you need to do to sell your house quickly and for top dollar? The answer starts with curb appeal.&nbsp;

Back in the old days, people went outside and drove around when they first started looking at homes, which meant a home’s curb appeal was very important. **It still is, but in 2019, curb appeal starts online.&nbsp;**

This means you need to make sure every room in your home is photo-ready. However, just because you take a lot of photos of your home doesn’t mean you should use all of them.&nbsp;
