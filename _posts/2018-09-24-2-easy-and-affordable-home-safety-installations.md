Earlier this week, I received an email in which I was asked for recommendations about home safety features, specifically exterior lighting and alarm systems.

Having timed lights or motion-activated lights is a good way to deter people from approaching your home at night when they shouldn’t be. They’re especially handy to have around exterior garages and front porch areas. Additionally, **accent lighting for your landscaping can also keep your yard well-lit and attractive.** These are projects that many homeowners do themselves, but our team has plenty of vendors that we can refer you to, so if you’re in need of an electrician to help you, reach out to us.

When installing these features, you do want to make sure of the quality of the lights you’re putting in. **Cheap lights are, well, cheap, and since they’ll be outside in the elements, you’ll want to get the best brand for your budget.** The commercial lighting industry has excellent products, though they are two to three times the price of generic lights. &nbsp;However, since you’re probably only going to be purchasing them once in your lifetime, it may be worth the expense. LED lights come highly recommended for their brightness and lifespan.

As far as alarm companies go, there are several out there to choose from. Personally, **I’d recommend CPI—we have a great contact in Randy Hankins, and we can refer you to his quality services.**

These are just a couple simple things you can do in order to make your home safer, as well as add some resale value to it. If you need any specific recommendations for vendors, we’d be happy to help. Contact us and we’ll be sure to set you up with trusted names and brands to help you enhance your home.
