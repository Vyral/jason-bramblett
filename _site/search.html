        "content": "Homeowners in the Triad are frustrated. Inventory is low, demand for their homes is high, and theyâre receiving multiple offers from prospective buyers, but home prices are still dropping.Selling your Triad area home? Get a free home analysis reportBuying a Triad area home? Search all homes for saleHow can that be? Supply and demand economics would say that if thereâs only a little bit of something that a lot of people want, the price should go up.In real estate, things donât always work this way. The factor that is causing this counterintuitive price drop is the banks. Banks donât care that youâre pushing home values up; they feel that a given home is worth X amount, therefore, the amount they will loan will reflect that.Now, the buyer can pay the difference out of pocket, but weâre seeing in certain price ranges that that is not always the case.âBE CAUTIOUS OUT THERE IF YOUâRE A HOMEOWNER.âBe cautious out there if youâre a homeowner attempting to sell your home. Just because you get the highest and best offer doesnât necessarily mean that itâs going to stick. It could come right back down to where it might have been in a more reasonable market.If you need help, Iâm here for you. Weâve been doing this a long time, so we can walk you through the process, make sure that we diligently price your property to get top dollar, and get every offer to stay. Do you really want to see a house four or five times just to get an offer to stick? Weâll always get you the most money in the shortest amount of time.For any questions or if you need assistance, feel free to reach out to me. Iâd be glad to help.",

Many people tell me, âI used this bank last time I refinanced my house and that went pretty good so I think Iâll use them again.â However, be careful.

Search all homes for saleHereâs what we are finding. People are being enticed by working with these big online lenders, but these lenders arenât giving the right information, funds, or materials in order to close on time. With our local lenders, we see the opposite. When you work with a local lender, you are much more likely to close on time.âWORKING WITH A LOCAL LENDER MAKES A HUGE, HUGE DIFFERENCE.âWe recently had a person who thought they had everything taken care of with their online lender, but the loan didnât close when it was supposed to. They are now going to have to stay in a hotel all weekend with their moving truck because we couldnât get the loan closed.If moving in on a specific day is important, donât risk it by saving $4 a month on your payment. Working with a local lender makes a huge, huge difference.

Get a free home analysis reportBuying a Triad area home? Search all homes for saleWeâve gotten this question a couple of times in the last few months, and today I wanted to take the time to talk about how to handle multiple-offer situations.From a sellerâs standpoint, having multiple offers is typically a good thing. You do have to be careful though. I have seen situations where a home has multiple offers, and then the seller gets a little too aggressive and ends up with no offers because everyone withdraws for whatever reason.We can coach you on how to handle multiple offers as a seller. The power of a third-party negotiator such as a real estate agent typically always yields a higher price for the home.From a buyerâs perspective, it can be a little bit scary to find yourself in a multiple-offer situation. Making your offer as clean as possible and allowing some of the terms to appease the seller is going to make it stand out amongst the competition.âWE CAN COACH YOU ON HOW TO HANDLE MULTIPLE OFFERS AS A SELLER.âNow I didnât say to make your offer have the highest price. There are aspects of an offer outside of the price that the seller will look at. Adjusting your offer to meet the sellerâs needs, such as a specific closing time and date, will sometimes put your offer to the top of the list.If you need some help with multiple-offer situations, both our buyer and our listing teams have been coached through many similar situations and can help you navigate that process easily.If you have any other questions about this topic or youâre looking to buy or sell a home, please give me a call.

Search all homes for saleDo you need an agent representing you when buying a new home?In our opinion, itâs very important to have representation as a buyer. When you visit a model home or a sales office, the person there isnât working for you. They are working for the builder and have their best interests in mind. It behooves you to have someone acting in your best interest as well. They are a second set of eyes on the paperwork and on all of the details in the contract. There are certain fees and non-refundable deposits that they are aware of. You might miss those if youâre doing things on your own.âHIRING AGENT REPRESENTATION IS ESSENTIAL.âAs someone who has been in real estate for a long time, I know the process of how to walk you through new construction from start to finish. I know the things to look for and can put leverage on the builder if things start to run behind. A huge benefit of hiring a buyerâs agent is their ability to juggle things around so that you have a smooth closing. They can also help be an advocate for other resources you may need such as an attorney, a home inspector, or a mortgage lender.Having agent representation during the new construction process is essential, whether youâre building your first home or your 12th. The extra professional looking out for your best interests is always a welcome addition.If you have any questions about hiring a buyerâs agent or anything else relating to the buying process, give me a call or send me an email.

If so, how do you know if itâs a wise investment?Older homes typically need a little more maintenance and love, but that shouldnât stop you from considering older homes if you have a solid budget. However, I think there are a few select groups that are probably better off not buying an older home:â¢ People just starting out their first home search  â¢ Those without three to six monthsâ worth of emergency funds  â¢ Anyone living paycheck to paycheck (You might even want a new home with a warranty)Just be cautious when shopping for homes; I see many homebuyers get into trouble buying an older home because of the location and taking on the risk of an older home. For example, if a house is 10 years old, it will probably need a new roof in the next 10 years. Some newer homes come with 30-year architectural shingles that you donât have to worry about for a very long time.âOLDER HOMES COME WITH MORE POTENTIAL MAINTENANCE RISKS THAN NEWER HOMES.âIf youâre considering an older home, just make sure youâre not only OK with these potential maintenance costs and headaches, but prepared for them as well.

In my 19 years in real estate, Iâve found that homes located near large power lines present an added risk to the buyer, and sellers tend to struggle selling them in our market. These properties have one of the highest foreclosure rates.However, they can also be a good investment opportunity as rentals. Iâve seen some of them be discounted by as much as 30% to 40%, and these homes were located in great neighborhoods as well. As far as renters are concerned, they know that theyâll only be there a short time, and the quality of the home is typically fantastic.âHOMES NEAR POWER LINES CAN BE GREAT AS RENTAL PROPERTIES.âThe prospect of buying one for your family is a decision youâll have to make, but Iâve seen phenomenal opportunities to buy discounted real estate in neighborhoods near large power lines.
