testimonial:
  - quote: I thought it was excellent, they definitely gave me more exposure as far as having my property there on the market and just getting it out where there would be more contacts. The different programs that they have as far as their sales and having the bonuses out there to allow other real estate firms in the area to kind of compete for your sale or trying to get a house sold in our case. That was just one of the different marketing ploys that are really advantageous for Jason Bramblett and associates.

  - quote: We had our house for sale for three years before listing with Jason. Once we switched to Jason, we were under contract within two weeks. I was very pleased. One of his agents told me that these potential buyers were looking for a house with a basement. I left a little note explaining that, while I didn’t have a basement, there was a lot of space in the attic. I think that information really made a difference.

  - quote: It was great! The condo wasn’t even on the market yet, but the renters moved out on the 17th of March and we closed on the 10th of April. I think Emily did a really great job. Jason came out and did the listing. Right away, we did the inspection and the appraisal. It just went boom, boom, boom, and it was done!

  - quote: We changed over from a different real estate agent, and Jason Bramblett was a whole lot better! We were pleased with him, and he was able to sell our house! The whole organization was professional from beginning to end. The biggest difference between them and the other agent was that they really stayed connected to us. They marketed our home much better than the other agent!

  - quote: Wes Bowman was our rep, and we were very pleased with the way things were handled. He was very knowledgeable, and answered any questions that we had. I’d heard Jason Bramblett’s commercials for a long time, and they did everything that they promised to do on their commercial. I've had issues with other folks who have commercials but didn't honor what they said, so I think it’s really good that he does.

  - quote: We were just so satisfied. My father had died, and my mom was selling their home. Jason and his team prepared the place, they posted it, they promoted it, and they sold it! Every step along the way, we felt like ours was the only case they had, and that they had a personal interest in my mother and her well-being. It was more than professional, it was professionally personal!

  - quote: Jason is positive, upbeat, a go-getter, and he will sell your home. He had professional photographers come out and even offered to have people come stage the home, which I didn’t need but it was nice that he offered. Even when I was unhappy with the pictures because I didn’t think it represented our detached garage well, he sent the photographers out again and had it fixed. I just think the world of him!

  - quote: Our house sold so fast that it was never even on the market! I decided to sell my house one day and Jason and his team sold it the day after. I didn’t even have to worry about cleaning my house for showings because it was never even shown! It was just sold! How much better can you do!

  - quote: We had been under contract with another Realtor for 6 months and our home was over-priced so it didn’t sell. After our contract ended we signed with Jason and within 2 weeks we had a contract on the house. Jason was straightforward, he told us his business plan, and he didn’t beat around the bush. He sold it for what the going rate is and it was an excellent experience. He priced our home competitively and he stuck by his word. I would highly recommend him to anybody!
